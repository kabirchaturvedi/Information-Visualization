Welcome to my GitHub repository where I present my visual analytics project on the Meta-Kaggle dataset. This project was conducted as part of the ENGR-E583 course, focusing on identifying and analyzing trends within the Kaggle community, which mirrors broader trends in the data science landscape.

### 1. Introduction
- Purpose
The aim of this project is to explore and uncover trends in Kaggle, reflecting broader data science trends through comprehensive visual analysis. This involves examining how various aspects such as competitions, submissions, and the popularity of programming languages and frameworks have evolved over time.

- Tech Stack
For this project, I utilized Python along with visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create the visualizations.

- Data Source
The analysis is based on the Meta-Kaggle dataset, which contains detailed records of Kaggle's major entities like competitions, submissions, kernels (code notebooks), and user activities.

### 2. Background
Kaggle serves as a crucial platform for data scientists to collaborate, compete, and share knowledge. The Meta-Kaggle dataset is rich in data, with over 5.6 million competitions and nearly 14 million datasets, making it an invaluable resource for understanding trends in the data science field.

### 3. Analysis of Competition Submissions
- Key Findings
Competitions related to financial predictions tend to attract a high number of submissions, likely due to substantial rewards.
The number of Kaggle competitions has declined after 2020, but the total number of submissions remains high, indicating a shift in platform focus or changes in user engagement.

### 4. Temporal Trends in Submissions
The analysis shows a clear upward trend in submissions from 2010 to 2023, with most submissions occurring before competition deadlines. This suggests strong engagement and adherence to timelines by the Kaggle community.

### 5. Popularity of Programming Languages
Python dominates due to its robust machine learning capabilities, while R maintains steady popularity for its statistical analysis strengths. The visualizations highlight Python as the preferred language for data science on Kaggle, with R catering to a niche audience.

### 6. Deep Learning Frameworks and R Packages Usage
I analyzed the mentions of popular deep learning frameworks like Keras, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, and R packages such as tidyverse, ggplot2, and dplyr in forum discussions. The findings show current trends and preferences in data science tools within the Kaggle community.

### 7. Data Science Techniques
The project also looks at the popularity of various data science techniques like NLP, computer vision, and feature engineering, particularly their increase during the COVID-19 pandemic. This part of the analysis provides insights into the diverse interests and expertise within the Kaggle community.

### 8. Conclusion and Future Work
The project highlights the ongoing interest in data science, with consistent growth in submissions and the use of advanced techniques and tools. Future work will focus on monitoring these evolving trends, particularly the uptake of new techniques and the shift in popular tools within the community.

### 9. Acknowledgments
I thank my project sponsor, Yashvardhan Jain, for the opportunity and my peers for their valuable feedback.
